# primera etapa

¡Bienvenid@s a la primera prueba del programa VélezReyes+ Tech Fellows 2024! We are so excited that you are here and to embark on this journey together.

As you can see, this journey will also be in _English_ and we hope that this process is also a great resource for you to practice your English and see it in action in technical contexts. If you are not entirely comfortable in English, we encourage you to use translation software, friends, anything! Please keep in mind that here at ver+ we value resourcefulness, a learning mindset, attention to detail, and care for each other above all else! 

### Instructions

There are three parts to this challenge, each in their own folder: each part contains its own questions. Each part has its own README with some light instructions on what is expected of each question. As you will see, most of the questions involve editing the question file in place, and in certain circumstances, a test harness is provided.

**TO START**:
_FORK_ the repository to commence the test. If you do not fork the repository, your participation will not be counted. Please DO NOT CLONE the repository, and make sure you fork it.

**TO SUBMIT**:
_CREATE A PULL REQUEST_ from your fork to our main branch. Your pull request must be open and registered in GitHub before the deadline. We will not accept merge requests from branches on the main repository, so please make sure you do fork the repository.

### The deadline is Sunday, November 5th at 3:00pm Colombia.
We will judge the timeliness of submissions by the timestamp of your pull request. Any pushes to the pull request AFTER the cutoff will NOT be considered. You will be notified of your results on November 8th.

```We wish you the best for this week!```

Remember that our team is here for you, and truly excited that each and everyone of you are here with the ambition and passion to transform both your lives and the lives of others through technology.

*What if I can't install the requirements on my localhost?*

We highly recommend that you find a way to complete this challenge locally. We have designed this to require minimal packages, and if you have access to a Linux terminal, you should be able to edit and run all the code. If you absolutely cannot do so at this stage, you can also use most online REPLs such as Github Dev or REPL.it which should support the packages needed. Please keep in mind that the second stage requires a proper localhost environment setup for full stack development.

*What if I don't understand certain instructions?*

Part of the test is seeing an existing code base and being able to navigate the documentation and files no matter what. We encourage you to use Google, translators, and to play around with the code until it makes more sense how to proceed. The ver+ team will unfortunately NOT be providing clarifications to the instructions.

*What if I discover a bug with the code?*

If you believe you've discovered a true error that would prevent anyone from completing the test, please message Karen Sun in the Slack channel. You should have received a link to the Slack channel if you are eligible for this stage of the test!

*What if I want to make changes to my pull request?*

Yay! That's the beauty of Git. If you create your pull request before the deadline and would like to make changes, go ahead and push new commits to your pull request. We will only judge the most recent code before the deadline. In fact, we encourage you to create a pull request early and make constant pushes.

*I found this repository. Can I make a submission?*

While you are free to use this repository to practice your engineering skills, only those who have been identified as eligible for this program and have been invited to our Slack program channel are eligible for the ver+ tech fellowship in 2024.


_If there are questions not addressed here about the class, please put your questions into the `#etapa1-test` channel in Slack_
