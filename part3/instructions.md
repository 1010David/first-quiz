In this part! We would love to hear a little from you... literally =)

## English
Please record a 30-60 second audio IN ENGLISH about your favorite technology learning resources. You can be as creative as you want! How do you learn? How do you like to learn? Where do you find what to learn? Please ensure the following:
- The audio must be in English. We will not process any submissions in Spanish. However! Please know we are not looking for perfect English, simply that you are taking the effort to study English well enough to be able to articulate something like this.
- Please, no more than 60 seconds. We would like to be able to give your audio our full attention!
- Your audio should be saved in this directory in any audio format such as wav, mp3, ogg, etc. and pushed to your branch with the rest of your solutions.

## Cloud Computing
In this section, we would like to learn a little about your experience with cloud computing platforms such as AWS, GCP, or Azure.

Hopefully, you are familiar with the pervasive social media app, Instagram! Instagram uses cloud computing services to ensure that you have a performant experience as an end user, and that it can serve billions of users around the world at scale. Instagram has a Stories feature in the top horizontal bar which displays video clips from users that you follow, valid for 24 hours, in reverse chronological order. Instagram manages to do this very fast and at scale! But how?

We would like you to think about the life cycle from when a user uploads a new story photo or video, to the point when it appears in the stories feed for another user. Which cloud computing services are likely being used along the way that allow it to optimize for speed and scale?

Please create an application flowchart architecture diagram that depicts this lifecycle from story upload to read, and which services are used for which entities and why.

Here are some tips!
- YOUR SUBMISSION CAN BE IN SPANISH
- [Here](https://cloudockit.medium.com/5-tips-for-drawing-organizing-your-aws-architecture-diagrams-1bf1e9d84fd1) are [some](https://davelms.medium.com/taking-a-first-look-at-google-cloud-architecture-diagramming-tool-35a1867356c9) [examples](https://creately.com/guides/aws-architecture-diagrams-and-use-cases/) of architecture diagrams
- We recommend you depict at least 6 difference services, and annotate the flow and services with a phrase about how they're being used specific to the lifecycle of an Instagram story
- We are NOT looking for a perfect solution, especially because there is no best architecture. We are looking for your understanding of how to use common cloud computing services to solve the main performance engineering problems.
- You can do this using any platform: draw the solution on a piece of paper and upload a picture of it, Google Drawings, a free Miro board, or any other virtual whiteboard method. The final submission must be a photo phile in this directory pushed to your branch
